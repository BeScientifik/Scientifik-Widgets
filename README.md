#Scientifik Widgets
==================

__Many device specific widgets for your WordPress website__

We've set out to create an extensive list of WordPress widgets that load specifically on their designated devices. 
With a mix of PHP conditionals by __[Mobile-Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect)__ and media queries we are much closer to a realy thorough, awesome widget pack that will display on the most popular target devices.


##License
__[GPLv2](https://github.com/BeScientifik/Scientifik-Widgets/blob/master/LICENSE)__ Please keep my Authorship and all links in tact. Thanks!


##Issues

I have tested with the most downloaded __[User-Agent switcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg)__ for Google Chrome. I have also tested on as many real world devices that I could get my hands on. So please feel free to test this plugin with any devices you may have available.
